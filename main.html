    <h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
    <p>
      To evaluate and compare different algorithms, instead of looking at the
      actual runtime for an algorithm, it makes more sense to use something
      called time complexity. Time complexity is more efficient than actual
      runtime, and does not consider factors such as programming language or
      hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm
      to run, relative to its input size. It includes both the fixed part (e.g.,
      variables, constants) and the variable part (e.g., dynamic memory
      allocations). An algorithm with space complexity O(n) requires memory
      proportional to the size of the input, making it efficient for handling
      larger datasets.
