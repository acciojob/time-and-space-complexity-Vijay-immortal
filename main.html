	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		 Time Complexity is a measure of computational efficiency of an algorithm
	</p><br>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to run, relative to its input size. it includes both the fixed part (e.g , variables, constants) and the variables part (e.g. , dynamic memory allocations). An algorithm with  <b>Space Complexity</b> O(n) requires memory proportional to the size of the imput, making it efficient for handling larger datasets.</p>
