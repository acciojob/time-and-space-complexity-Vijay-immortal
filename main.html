	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		 Time Complexity is a measure of computational efficiency of an algorithm.Indicating how the runtime grows as the input size increasesA well optimized algorithm has lower Time Complexity making it more efficient
	</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs in relation to the input size. For example, an algorithm that requires additional storage proportional to the input size has a space complexity of O(n</p>
