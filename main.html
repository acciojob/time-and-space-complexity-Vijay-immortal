	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		To evaluate and compare different algorithms, instead of looking at the actual runtime for an algorithm, it make more sense to use something called time complexity. Time Complexity is more efficient than actual runtime, and does not consider factors such as programming language or hardware.
	</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to run, relative to its input size. it includes both the fixed part (e.g , variables, constants) and the variables part (e.g. , dynamic memory allocations). An algorithm with  <b>Space Complexity</b> O(n) requires memory proportional to the size of the imput, making it efficient for handling larger datasets.</p>
